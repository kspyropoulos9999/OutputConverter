This code allows users to input Python code interactively, executes it, captures the output, and generates both a PDF and an HTML file displaying the code output. 
It uses libraries like ReportLab, Dominate, and FPDF to create the PDF and HTML documents. Users can input Python code, 
and the program will execute it, displaying the output in both PDF and HTML formats. 
If any errors occur during execution, they are handled gracefully, and the error message is included in the output files.
